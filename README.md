# visualize_logs

A Python library and command line tools to provide log visualization. 

# Gallery

When you view these plots you will need JavaScript turned on.  The plots are interactive and you can
select borders around the pieces you would like to zoom into.  You can double click to zoom out.  You can also
hover over nodes and more information will be displayed.  
The plot controls will be in the upper right hand corner of the plot.

The plot will look different depending on your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc...) and the size
of your browser.  I typically use Chrome on a Mac with a very large size to see everything I want to see.
The smaller your browser is, the more crunched it will be.  If you change your browser size, be sure to click
'Reload'.

The "focused" views were generated by selecting just the PIDs I wanted to show with ProcMon before
saving the data to a CSV.

# Log Type Support

This package currently supports the following types of logs:
  - ProcMon CSV
    - Be sure to either turn on all columns or use [DetailedProcmonConfiguration.pmc](ProcMon/Configuration File/DetailedProcmonConfiguration.pmc)

More logs types are coming...

# Requirements

Graphviz must be installed and available in your path (dot, neato, etc..)
  - http://www.graphviz.org/

To install Graphviz correctly on a Mac, you will probably want to run the following command:

```
brew install graphviz --with-gts
```

This program was written with Python 3 on a Mac and Windows 7.  It should work with Python 2 and other OS's, but it has not been tested
extensively.  Please file an issue if you have problems running it somewhere.  I use Windows less than I use a Mac, so your Windows mileage may
vary.

# Usage

This package can be used as a library.  Use the information in the documentation section below to use it this way.
This package also contains command line tools which are outlined below.

## ProcMon CSV Command Line Tool

The best use case is if you start your ProcMon capture before you run the file you are analyzing.  If a process 
is not started the associated network connections may not be connected to the process in the plot.  I also could
not get ProcMon to capture TCP data when WinPCAP was installed.  You may not want to install WinPCAP if you are
interested in TCP data.

This this library feels like it is taking a long time, it is likely that you are trying to import a lot of ProcMon
data.  You can always filter your data and save it as a CSV showing just the events you want to graph.

```
# plotprocmoncsv -h
usage: plotprocmoncsv [-h] [-f HTMLFile] [-pa] [-pf] [-pu] [-pt] [-pr] [-pfw]

```

You can run it like this:

```
# plotprocmoncsv -pa -sp -st -sh wwwlgoogle.CSV 
Reading log: wwwlgoogle.CSV
Plotting log: wwwlgoogle.CSV
```

... and then your plot appears in your web browser!  It is also saved to `procmoncsv.html`.

# Sample data:

You can find some sample CSV from ProcMon in the [ProcMon/Sample Data] (ProcMon/Sample Data/) directory.
There are four traces:

- wwwlgoogle.com malware:
  - Focused just shows the process I ran, filtered by the ProcMon process tree tool.
  - All data without the focus.
- Ransomware:
  - Focused just shows the process I ran, filtered by the ProcMon process tree tool.
  - All data without the focus.

# Similar Projects

These projects are very similar to this one and are worth trying if you are
unfamiliar with them.  They were the inspiration behind this project.  This project
was meant to compliment these tools, not replace them.  This is just a different way to
get to the same goal, with the goal being to support numerous log types in one Python
package in the future.
